## Introduction

Selenium WebDriver is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. This repository hosts various web automation tasks implemented using Selenium WebDriver in Java. These tasks showcase how Selenium can be used to automate repetitive tasks on websites.

## Requirements

To run the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) (version >= 8)
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) (installation instructions included below)
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

## Setup

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: If you don't have JDK installed, download and install it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Selenium WebDriver**: Download the Selenium WebDriver Java bindings from the [official Selenium website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) or add it as a dependency to your Maven or Gradle project.

    If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
        <version>3.141.59</version> <!-- Update with the latest version -->
    </dependency>
    ```

    For Gradle, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation 'org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java:3.141.59' // Update with the latest version
    }
    ```

## Usage

To run the automation scripts:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sheikh-foyjul-islam/selenium-web-automation.git
    ```

2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).

3. Navigate to the cloned repository in your IDE and locate the Java files containing the automation scripts.

4. Run the desired Java class containing the script using your IDE's execution/run functionality.
